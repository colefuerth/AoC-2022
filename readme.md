# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

## Usage

Solutions are solved in Python3.10. To run a solution, use the following command:

```bash
python3.10 AoC.py input.txt
```

Some of these will be in Rust, since I want to better learn this language. To run a solution, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release input.txt
```
